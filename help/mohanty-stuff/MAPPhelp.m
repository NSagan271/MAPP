%
%MAPP help system is invoked by "help MAPP" and lists all primary help topics.
%
%SUGGESTED NAVIGATION THROUGH THE MAPP HELP SYSTEM:
%Before navigating through the different help topics provided under the MAPP
%help system, you might want to run the script "MAPPquickstart". This script
%interactively takes the user through a step-by-step process of doing three
%basic analyses (DC,AC and transient) on different circuits in MAPP. Once
%familiarized with some of the functionalities of MAPP with the help of this
%quickstart guide, you can follow the following suggested route to further
%acquaint yourself with various functionalities, how-tos, extension and
%customization options for MAPP.
%
%1. Enter "help MAPPexamplesdeoms" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   list of available examples/demos (MATLAB scripts) performing three
%   different kinds of analyses (DC,AC, and transient) on various circuit DAEs.
%   You can run these scripts by entering their name at the MATLAB command
%   line. 
%
%2. When you enter "help MAPPexamplesdeoms", along with a list of available 
%   examples/demos, a set of detailed examples are provided to perform
%   different analyses on a circuit DAE. Instructions are provided on how to
%   run the scripts with different options. The user needs to write the code by
%   referring to the examples (or copy/paste) and can experiment with different
%   available options as suggested by the examples.
%
%3. Enter "help MAPPcompactmodel-how-tos" at the MATLAB command line. This
%   tutorial introduces the user to different concepts of compact modeling in
%   MAPP and shows how to develop compact models in MAPP. In this brief
%   tutorial, links to additional resources (e.g., presentations, video
%   lectures) for the user interested in knowing more about compact modeling
%   are also provided.
%
%The next help topics deal with the fundamental concepts and various supported
%features of the MAPP simulator. Detailed treatment of topics such as how to
%work with individual circuit DAEs and devices are provided. The focus is also
%on emphasizing the modularity of the MAPP framework that enables rapid
%prototyping of custom compact models and new simulation algorithms. 
%
%4. Enter "help MAPPdevicemodels" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   tutorial that introduces the user to the concept of device model and shows
%   how to create robust compact models of novel devices in MAPP using the
%   ModSpec API. It also provides a list of available device models in MAPP. 
%
%5. Enter "help MAPPcircuitDAE" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   tutorial that introduces the user to the concept of circuits and their
%   representation using differential-algebraic-equations (DAEs). The list of
%   all available circuit DAEs in MAPP are also provided.
%
%5. Enter "help MAPPanalyses" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   tutorial that introduces the user to the generic concept of analysis of
%   circuits.  Some illustrative examples are also provided. The list of
%   analyses that are supported in the current version of MAPP are also
%   provided.
%
%6. Enter "help MAPPvecvalder" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   tutorial that introduces the user to the concept of automatic
%   differentiation and its implementation in vecvalder package. The current
%   shortcomings of vecvalder together with their workarounds are also
%   mentioned.  Examples are also presented to show how vecvalder can be used
%   in other applications as well.
%
%7. Enter "help MAPPstructure" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   tutorial that introduces the user to the general directory structure of the
%   MAPP code. This enables the user to understand the way code for MAPP has
%   been arranged. 
%
%8. Enter "help MAPPcustomization" at the MATLAB command line. This shows a
%   tutorial that introduces possibilities and how-tos of extending and
%   customizing the MAPP code. 
%   
%
%
%REMARKS:
%1. In the MAPP help syntax, anything inside double-quotes ("...") should
%   be reproduced verbatim at the MATLAB command line.
