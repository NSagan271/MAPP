%MAPPtest system has an in-built automated testing system which tests DC, AC and transient
%analyses on various circuit DAEs. This functionality is invoked by running the
%script "MAPPtest_analyses".
%
%There are three different scripts that are executed when a call to
%"MAPPtest_analyses" is made.
%
%MAPPtest_analyses: Calls following three routines:
%      MAPPtest_transient: Performs transient tests on various circuit DAEs
%      MAPPtest_DCsweep  : Performs DC sweep tests on various circuit DAEs
%      MAPPtest_AC       : Perform AC analysis tests on various circuit DAEs
%
%<TODO>: Add help (/w examples) how all above three scripts work.
