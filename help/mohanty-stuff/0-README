TODO: COMPLETE THIS ONCE THE HELP SYSTEM IS IN FINAL FORM 

This is the instruction file for how the MAPP help system works for the
MATLAB version (henceforth, MAPP-MATLAB) and you can comment your new
MATLAB code so that it confirms to the standard expected by the help
system. 

-- Before understanding how the MAPP-MATLAB help system works, you must
   aware of how the MATLAB help system works in general. If you do not,
   then go read it here (Note that this link is active as of June 26th
   2013):

   http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/help.html

   Reading some more "help"-related documents off the internet may be
   useful too. Just "google" (TODO: Why don't we actually provide this?)

1. As there is no specific directory or file called MAPP(.m), a
   directory called "MAPP" is created in
   MAPP-installation/Documentation/MAPP with a file "Contents.m". During
   the installation process (see the "Makefil.in"), this directory and
   file are created. 

   IMP: The Contents.m file is a MATLAB all-line-commented script, the
   contents of which (except addition of "%" sign before each line) are
   read from /MAPP-svn-workingcopy/help/help_MAPP.txt
