Verilog-A and Multi-Physics Models in MAPP: A Hands-On Workshop

                       8am-6pm
                Thursday, Feb 4, 2015

         University of California, Berkeley
             Hughes Room, 400 Cory Hall
                 Berkeley, CA 94720


Berkeley's Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform (MAPP) is a MATLAB-based
platform that provides a complete environment for developing, testing,
experimentally validating and inserting compact models in open source
simulation platforms.  It is also useful for prototyping new simulation
algorithms.

This hands-on workshop will focus on the newly developed Verilog-A to ModSpec
device model translator for MAPP, dubbed VAPP (Verilog-A Parser and
Processor). The goal of the workshop is to illustrate how MAPP facilitates the
development of simulation ready compact models. An overview of MAPP's
multi-physics modelling and simulation capabilities will also be provided.
A hands-on refresher on MAPP will be provided for those who have no prior
experience with it. 

Please bring your laptop (running linux, OSX or Windows). It would be very
helpful if you already have MATLAB installed and running on your laptop;
otherwise you may need to access the hands-on components through the web.

                               Wang, Archit Gupta, Jaijeet Roychowdhury)

              Participants will set up and test VAlint, VAPP and MAPP on their 
              laptops.

9:30AM        Hands on MAPP refresher (Tianshi Wang)

              The presenter will outline the capabilities and features of 
              MAPP/ModSpec and guide participants in using them to model simple 
              devices and simulate small circuits using MAPP's DC, and 
              transient analyses.
              - recap: how to start
                - model_starter() - quickly get something working, refresh
                  people's motor memory (typing, etc.). 
                  - resistor first in model_starter
                    - will need to explain d/dt qe anyway here
                    - then the "theory slide" on the resistor
                    - then the Verilog-A code 
                    - model exerciser
                  - diode w capacitor in model_starter
                    - theory slide w d/dt
                    - limexp/safeexp
                      - parameters (not in Verilog-A)
                    - then the Verilog-A code (and forward ref Gokcen)
                    - model exerciser
                  - Shichman-Hodges (3- terminal) without internal nodes
                    - no model starter - just give them the wrapper code
                    - show the Verilog-A
                    - model exerciser - char curves
              --------------------------------------------------------
                - circuit example in MAPP: resistor/diode/cap
                  - give them the netlist in MAPP
                  - dc, ac, transient in MAPP
                - circuit example: SH with RC load
                  - give them the netlist (just use capModSpec)
                    - tell them about help MAPPdevices over here
                  - DC/AC/transient - just in MAPP
                  - netlist in Xyce, run in Xyce (questions -> Tom)
              --------------------------------------------------------
                - (we could stop the hands-on part here if needed, doing the
                   rest as a demo)
              --------------------------------------------------------
                - the rest of the "theory" slides, illustated using RRAM
                  template
                  - implicit equations (together with explicit outputs)
                    - motivation using FEFET curve (forward ref to Gokcen)
                    - implicit resistor - no hands on, just show it and run it
                    - model exerciser
                  - internal unks and equations (m of them; vecy)
                    - here, move to RRAM template
                    - first show the theory slide, count 
                    - then show the RRAM template eqns (both) - simple f1/f2
                      functions
                      - internal unk s and corresponding extra eqn (which is
                        implicit)
                      - plus an explicit output equation
                    - model exerciser
                    - Verilog-A version (explain, including inelegance
                                        compared to ModSpec, tolerances of
                                        node voltages in simulators, etc.; so
                                        you need to scale it to around 1 -
                                        Stanford model has a gap of 1e-9)
                      - external nodes p, n
                      - declare an internal node sn, branch sb = (sn, n)
                      - s = 1e-9*v(sb) # scaling
                      - i(sb) <+ SOMEOTHERSCALE*f2(vpn, s)
                      - i(sb) <+ SOMEOTHERSCALE*ddt(-s)
                      - i(pn) <+ f1(vpn, s)
                  - uSrcs
                    - motivating example: vsrc/isrc, RRAM (eg, Monte-Carlo
                      noise contribution)
                    - no support in model starter yet (because of low use)
                    - advanced feature: just put it in the wrapper code
                      directly, following examples
                    - here's an example: simple RTN noise model in the filament:
                      - i(pn) <+ f1(vpn, s) + un1(t) # RTN
                      - i(sb) <+ SOMEOTHERSCALE*ddt(-s) + un2(t) # Stanford
                    - Verilog-A does not currently support this, but we will 
                      and propose this as an extension
              --------------------------------------------------------
              - finally, the RRAM
                - first, the physical explanation: especially of the
                  length/gap under +ve and -ve DC excitations (the "physics")
                - then, f1 and f2 for a RRAM model (as an example)
                  - with attribution: f1 from Stanford, f2 from Michigan
                - then run a small circuit with it in MAPP (series w resistor,
                  has hysteresis in transient)
                  - do also a DC sweep and homotopy; AC not interesting now,
                    LTV AC would be better
                - make an oscillator with it and show
                - then run the Verilog-A in Xyce

              - Verilog-A vs Modspec, if the issue comes up
                - ModSpec transparency vs Verilog-A
                  - show Lan Wei example (have it at hand)
                    - confusion wrt implicit equations; undeclared
                      or un-initialized variables
              - RRAM
                -

10:25AM       Hands on MAPP refresher (contd., Tianshi Wang)

12:00PM       Working lunch (presentation/demo by Tianshi Wang)
              
              During lunch, the presenter will outline and demonstrate MAPP's 
              multi-physics modelling and simulation capabilities, using 
              opto-electronics and spintronics examples.

              - 2m gloss on optical stuff - show previous slides and then
                move on to spintronic
              - 2m mention what you have already that kind of works: thermal,
                spintronic, optical, RRE, magnetics (MMFs, magnetic flux), 
                mechanical (1-d kinematic - spring mass, and kinematic_v)
              - focus on spintronic
                - CPP spin switch: FM-NM-FM sandwich - two-terminal device/circuit
                  - show the schematic
                  - the electrical interface: regular (focus on KCL)
                    - including for a 2-t device; iin = iout
                  - the spin component (3-vector) interface
                    - 2t device: no relationship between spinin and spinout
                  - spin connections:
                    - ee: standard
                    - spin: basically 3-KCL, and 3-KVL (node voltages)
                    - magnetic moment: 3-vector: equality constraints (no summation)
                  - show the matrix equations for a ferromagnet
                    - I1_4vec = M^-1 * Gs * M * V1_4vec + M^-1 * Gser * M * (V1_4vec - V2_4vec)
                    - I2_4vec = M^-1 * Gs * M * V2_4vec + M^-1 * Gser * M * (V2_4vec - V1_4vec)
                    - nonlinear because of rotation
                  - no dynamics yet - (because LLG not implemented)
                    

1:30PM        Hands on tutorial on using VAlint/VAPP/MAPP for device
              model development (Gokcen Mahmutoglu and Xufeng Wang)

              The presenters will guide participants in using VAlint, VAPP and
              MAPP to develop/refine simple compact models in Verilog-A: 
              starting with checking the Verilog-A model using VAlint, then
              translating to ModSpec using VAPP, using MAPP to see
              characteristic curves, and finally, simulating small circuits
              using MAPP's DC, AC and transient analyses. Good modelling
              practices will be discussed and demonstrated.

              - Gokcen has a nice cheatsheet already ready:
                - start with slides in LibreOffice - outlining or reminding
                  them the general flow
                  - JR to send Gokcen an updated version of the flow
                - first install/test VAPP
                - quickly run something (FEFET) to completion (analysis) using
                  VAPP and MAPP 
                - work through a diode example (typing some Verilog-A in)
                  - also see the ModSpec produced
                  - upto running ckt in MAPP
                    - char curves, transient that goes on forever, then add an
                      internal resistor and/or limexp
                - go back to the FEFET
                  - slides/xournal on the neg cap model and the QV curve
                    - also through VAPP + model exerciser
              - BSIM3 example (not hands on, necessarily)
              - BSIM4 example
                - explaining why it doesn't work yet, and what will never
                  work (simulation directives, other stuff)
              - Xufeng and VAlint demo at the end, together with:
                - really finally, mention some guidelines (eg for Verilog-A)
                  - DO use branches
                  - DECLARE/INITIALISE all variables
                    - even if you want it set to 0; don't be lazy 
                  - VERILOG-A: understand well what I(br) <+ f(Ibr)
                    - Tianshi has some slides from long ago (ask for Purdue
                      tutorial)
                    - know hacks for doing 0 = f(...) equations
                  - no implicit global ground (declare an extra terminal if
                    necessary)
                  - NO SIMULATION DIRECTIVES (model should work and be
                    consistent for all analyses, present past and future)
                  - NEVER idt
                  - NEVER any time-varying or random function
                    - though we understand that commercial simulators currently
                      don't have usrc support, so this is difficult
              --------------------------------------------------------

              LIST OF THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT LATER
              -----------------------------------
              - MAPP public release
              - Xufeng: using VAPP for error processing
              - Tom Russo: using VAPP for something?
              - C++ ModSpec for Sandia and our efficiency (recall make
                                                    menuconfig plan for MAPP)
              - VAPPtest
              - auto-generate derivative code, removing need for vecvalder
                for models in Verilog-A
              - Octave compatibility of VAPP
                - hash tables for efficiency
                - some class things?
                - must decide in conjunction with John Eaton
                - maybe ask him to support python-like indexing for multi-d
                  arrays
              - modules/hierarchy support in Verilog-A
                - will this depend on modules/hierarchy/netlist support within ModSpec?

2:45PM        Coffee Break

3:00PM        VAlint/VAPP/MAPP (contd.)

4:30PM        Break

4:45PM        Open QA/discussion session
             - also spillover time if previous activities run over

Old Tentative Agenda: 
----------------

8:00AM        Coffee, juice, and rolls

8:30AM        Introduction to NEEDS and MAPP (Mark Lundstrom and Jaijeet 
                                                                Roychowdhury)

9:00AM        Hands-on tutorial on VAlint/VAPP and their use (Gokcen
                Mahmutoglu and Xufeng Wang)

              The presenters will guide participants in using VAlint and
              MAPP to develop a simple compact model in Verilog-A: checking
              the Verilog-A model using VAlint, translating to ModSpec using
              VAPP, using MAPP to see characteristic curves, and simulating
              small circuits in DC, AC and transient analyses. Good modelling
              practices will be discussed and demonstrated.

10:15AM       Break

10:25AM       VAPP and its use (contd., Gokcen Mahmutoglu)

12:00PM       Working lunch (presentation by Tianshi Wang)

              Tianshi will show how NEEDS and VAPP will enable model developers
              to simulate their Verilog-A models in Sandia's open source
              circuit simulator Xyce. Recent progress will be demonstrated and
              future plans will be discussed.

1:30PM        Hands on tutorial on multi-physics modelling and simulation
              using MAPP (Tianshi Wang)
              
              A unique feature of MAPP is the ability to customize it to
              support devices and networks in domains beyond electronics.  The
              presenter will guide participants in modelling
              spintronic/opto-electronic devices, connecting them in circuit
              netlists and simulating them using DC, AC and transient
              analyses.

2:45PM        Coffee Break

3:00PM        Multi-physics modelling and simulation (contd., Tianshi Wang)

4:15PM        Break

4:30PM        Hands-on tutorial on using homotopy in MAPP to characterize
              FE-FETs (Gokcen Mahmutoglu and Jaijeet Roychowdhury)

              Negative differential capacitance in ferro-electric FETs leads
              multiple possible drain currents for some values of bias, i.e.,
              DC characteristic curves feature "folds" or "turning points".
              The presenters will guide participants in using the
              homotopy/continuation analysis features of MAPP to characterize
              an FE-FET model effectively.

6:00PM        Meeting Adjourns
