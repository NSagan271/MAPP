Experimental data:

Two experimental data sets are provided from Intel: 32 nm and 45 nm N-type devices.

SET I:

idvd_Intel_32_nFET_09.txt
idvg_Intel_32_nFET_09.txt

SET II:

idvd_Intel_45_nFET_12.txt
idvg_Intel_45_nFET_12.txt

For Id vs. Vd data, first column is Vd, second column is Vg, and third column is Id.
For Id vs. Vg data, first column is Vg, second column is Id at Vd = 0.05V, and third column is Id at Vd = 1V.
