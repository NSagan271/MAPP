This directory contains the following:

ModSpec-MATLAB-API/
	- Matlab version of ModSpec API and models (written by JR, 2012)
	  - see ModSpec-MATLAB-API/0-README

ModSpec-C++-API/
	- C++ version of ModSpec API and models (written by JR, 2012)
	- see ModSpec-C++-API/0-README

doc/
	- some tentative documentation

Verilog-A-models/
	- source for some Verilog-A models (including BSIM, DAAV6)

amsallem/ - old stuff, mostly David Amsallem's

	ModSpec-doc.txt 
		- documentation on ModSpec - HIGHLY OUT OF DATE and INCOMPLETE

	run_testcases.m
		- a user-friendly driver that will help run tests. run this
		  first.

	DeviceLibrary.d/
		- contains ModSpec files for various devices, together with lists
		  of all the models available, and utility functions for reading
		  these lists.

	Parsers/
		- contains parsers to read netlists and return a DS object
		  - DS is a data structure containing all information about
		    the circuit: what elements there are, the graph structure,
		    links to the ModSpec model functions, etc..
		  - DS is currently called DeviceStruct. A more descriptive name
		    for it might be: NetworkElementModelDataStruct

	Equation-Engines/
		- contains different equation engines (eg, MNA, Sparse Tableau)
		  that take DS and return a DAE.

	Solvers/
		- numerical solvers (eg, NR, transient) that take a DAE and analyse
		  them. (CURRENTLY EMPTY; NR and transient solvers with limiting is
		  hardcoded in testParserEquationEngine.m, needs to be taken out and
		  put in here).

	MOR/
		- David's nonlinear MOR code - focussing on gappy methods for neuron
		  system.

	Tests.d/
		- contains various test input files (netlists).

	utilities/
		- misc utility functions that can be useful.

	to-delete/
		- obsolete stuff scheduled to be deleted.
