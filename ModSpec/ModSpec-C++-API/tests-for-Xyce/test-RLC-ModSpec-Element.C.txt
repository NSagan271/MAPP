 * the device: a 3-terminal element with RLC elements inside it

 *
 * topology:
 * - the external nodes are 1, 2, and 3. 3 is the reference node.
 * - between nodes 1 and 2, there is a resistor R
 * - between nodes 2 and 3, there are a capacitor C and an inductor L in series
 *
 * unknowns:
 * 	n = 2, 2n = 4
 * 	NIL.NodeNames = "n1", "n2"
 * 	NIL.RefNodeName = "n3"

Equation formulation for Xyce:

1. vecE, vecI and vecY (inputs to the device):

   vecE = [e1; e2; e3];
   vecI = []; // no branch voltage explicit outputs
   vecY = [vL; iL];

2. vecX and vecY
   vecX = [v13; v23] = [1 0 -1; 0 1 -1] * vecE
   vecY: as above

3. vecZ and vecW
   vecZ = [i13; i23] = [(v13-v23)/R; -(v13-v23)/R + d/dt (C (v23-vL))]
   vecW = [LBCR; intKCL] = [L diL/dt - vL; - d/dt[C (v23-vL)] + iL]

4. f and q for Xyce = [KCLs; KVLs; vecW] (the equations of the device)

   KCLs:
	n1 KCL: += i13 = ((e1-e3)-(e2-e3))/R. Stamps: Jf: [1 -1 0 | 0 0]; Jq: [0 0 0 | 0 0]
	n2 KCL: += i23 = -(e1-e2)/R + d/dt (C * e2-e3-vL). Stamps: Jf: [-1 1 0 | 0 0];  Jq: [0 1 -1 | -1 0]
	n3 KCL: += -(i13-i23). Stamps: Jf: [-1 1 0 | 0 0];  Jq: [0 1 -1 | -1 0]

   KVLs: none

   vecW: as above
   	LBCR:	L diL/dt - vL. 	Stamps: Jf: [0 0 0 | -1 0]; Jq: [0 0 0 | 0 1]
	intKCL:	- d/dt[C (v23-vL)] + iL. Stamps: Jf: [0 0 0 | 0 1]; Jq: [0 1 -1 | -1 0]
